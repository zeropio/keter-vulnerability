# Keter Vulnerability
### WIP

# Install with npm

First we need to make sure we have npm on our computer.
- [npm installation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/install)

Then, we copy the github.
```bash
mkdir keter && cd keter
git clone -b api https://github.com/zeropio/keter-vulnerability.git
mv keter-vulnerability api

git clone -b app https://github.com/zeropio/keter-vulnerability.git
mv keter-vulnerability app
```

Now we run the backend:
```bash
cd api
make install
make start
```

And then the frontend:
```bash
cd app
make install
make start
```

# Install with Docker

Coming soon!
